          I'm a bioinformatician, from Marseille, working in Stockholm.
          I'm interested in Reproducible Research (and obviously open-source), Cancer, Automation, Containers, Data Integration, Visualization and much more...
          I enjoy doing pipeline with Nextflow, that are reproducible using Conda, Docker, Singularity and can run anywhere, including AWS.
          I'm part of the core team that administrates the <a href="https://github.com/nf-core" target="_blank">@nf-core</a> community.

          The owl is the symbol of Athena or Minerva.
          Athena who protected Ulysses during his journey.
          This owl is made from an idea I had, magnified and re-drawn by CÃ©lia.
          Then vectorized via Inkscape by my own hands.
          And finally redesigned again.
