I handle my bibliography with Mendeley.
Mendeley keeps references and informations in a BibTex file.
Some of the Northern authors have an ø in their name.
Mendeley encodes it with `\o` and a white space.
When I compile my document, in my bibliography, I find this white space after the `ø` in the name of the Northern authors.
I tried `\o` without a white space, but it’s not working.
You must use `{\o}`.
I came up with this solution, copying the BibTex files, removing unwanted informations (ie abstract, url etc…), and replacing `\o` by `{\o}`:

```bash
#!/bin/bash

cat /home/user/biblio/*.bib | grep -v "url = {" | grep -v "file = {" | \
  grep -v "abstract = {" | grep -v "keywords = {" | grep -v "isbn = {" | \
  grep -v "issn = {" | grep -v "editor = {" | grep -v "address = {" | \
  grep -v "annote = {" > biblio.bib

sed -i 's/\\o /\{\\o\}/g' biblio.bib
```
