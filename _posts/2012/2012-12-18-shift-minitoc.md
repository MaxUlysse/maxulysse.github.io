Another post about LaTex, but you’re in the middle of your thesis redaction, and you finally found a solution to something that’s been bothering you for quite a time, it’s a good idea to keep it somewhere.

Here, all begun with a problem with the `TOC` (Table of Contents).

Some items in the `TOC` where associated with the wrong page numbers after compiling the tex file, so I used the `tocbibind` package who handles it fine, and finally I can stop fighting with:

```LaTeX
\phantomsection
\addcontentsline{toc}{chapter}{}
```

But, by adding a TOT (Table of Tables) and a TOF (Table of Figures), the intern `minitoc` within each chapter became shifted. I got the `minitoc` from chapter 1 in chapter 4…

To prevent this, you should add `\mtcaddchapter` after declaring each TOC, TOT and TOF:

```LaTeX
% TOC
\tableofcontents
\mtcaddchapter
% TOT
\listoftables
\mtcaddchapter
% TOF
\listoffigures
\mtcaddchapter
```
