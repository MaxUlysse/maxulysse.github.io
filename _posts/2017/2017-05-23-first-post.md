## Hello world

I was getting tired of Wordpress, so I decided to try out Jekyll hosted on GitHub, and I'm quite happy with the result.

If you want to know more about the template I'm using, you can look at [the repository <i class="fab fa-github" aria-hidden="true"></i>](https://github.com/maxulysse/maxulysse.github.io).

I kind of like the philosophy of using such a tool.
It reminds me a lot of LaTeX in fact.

And I do like the possibility to write everything in markdown.
